A Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) is a combination of a fully programmable AND/OR array and a bank of macrocells. The AND/OR array is reprogrammable and can perform a multitude of logic functions. 
CPLD Board Details. The CPLD used in the design is a XC9536XL CPLD from Xilinx. This CPLD is powered from 3.3V. Xilinx do have 5V CPLDs, but these are usually much more expensive than the 3.3V CPLD range. The circuit is powered entirely from 3.3V. The AVR microcontroller has been added primarily to provide a clock source While I was working on a retro computing project (Z80 single board computer), my friend gave me a small pile of XC9572 CPLDs. I am a poor college student and I can't afford a the real deal, so I am forced to choose between a clone of the DLC9, or a legit Xilinx Parallel Cable IV. I looked into using XSVF players and generic JTAG devices to write to the XC9500 CPLDs, but it looks like a lot of devices just plain can't do it. Has anyone here used either a DLC9 clone or a Parallel Cable Re: Hardware and software required to program a CPLD. Yes, if I remember correctly you just connect the programming cable to the CPLD, re-scan the JTAG chain, and the CPLD will pop up as the only device in the chain. If it's possible, then I have a few more questions: what software I should use to compile (from RPi) Verilog/VHDL? what software I should use to flash the compiled output to CPLD? last but not least, what CPLD should I use? E.g. any in-system programmable CPLD will do? Thanks in advance! UPDATE: after a chat with opneocd! ( folks on irc, I found that it is possible to use rpi as a jtag programmer. I also found that other people already succeeded (check. Starting a New Xilinx CPLD Project in ISE. A VHDL project for configuring a Xilinx CPLD is created. The example simply connects inputs (a bank of 8 switches interfaced to CPLD pins) to outputs (8 LEDs interfaced to CPLD pins) within the CPLD. The example uses the home built CPLD board which contains a XC9536XL CPLD and the home built parallel cable.  Edit: Solved! Thanks BennVenn! I'm working on creating a custom flash-based cartridge for Game Boy as a learning experience. I'm using a 1Mbit parallel flash chip as memory and a Xilinx CPLD as the MBC. For testing purposes, I haven't implemented any MBC logic yet, so the CPLD is simply acting as a logic level shifter, converting the 5V signals from the Game Boy to 3.3V signals for the flash chip (the Game Boy should be able to read the 3.3V signals back because it uses TTL logic).

I'm a student so I have a tight budget. I understand digital circuits, but I'm very unfamiliar with actual components. I intend to brush up on Verilog, and I would like to "see" the outcomes firsthand. Anything that would be conducive to learning would be terrific (at least a few LEDs or something). -Thanks.

Hi, I'm working on a very advanced science project right now and am in need of someone who can design a special IC chip. Any suggestions. Xilinx, Inc. (/ ˈ z aɪ l ɪ ŋ k s / ZY-links) is an American technology company and is primarily a supplier of programmable logic devices. It is known for inventing the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and as the semiconductor company that created the first fabless manufacturing model. I am a seasoned software developer but a noob on the FPGA side. While searching for books for self-study i came across FPGAs for Software Programmers (https://www.amazon.com/FPGAs-Software-Programmers-Dirk-Koch/dp/3319264060/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8ampqid=1499608796ampsr=8-1ampkeywords=fpga+for+software) which sounds intriguing and seems to be the direction in which FPGA programming is headed. Question is: Is this a good book to learn FPGA knowledge/programming. Hi all, I'm looking at building essentially a high-speed PWM controller for many channels for LED lights. I've tried it with microcontrollers, but can't get the speed required for large channels (and micros don't have enough PWMs), so was thinking of building something myself using FPGAs ampamp/ CPLDs. I've used FPGAs a bit before, many years ago, for a course at uni, but haven't recently. However, for the price of an IC, I'd prefer to use CPLDs, as I'm going to need gt100 of these. A friend and I are doing some stuff with TTL-circuits, and need a circuit that takes a 4-bit input, and results in an 8-bit output, from a table of values. Our first thought was to use 8-bit line drivers, and hardwire the inputs. However, this would be 18-20 chips. Another possibility could be to use an EPROM or a similar device, but they don't come this small, and seem like a bit overkill. The final option I've thought of, is to implement the combinational logic, and try to simplify 
I have pretty much written off Xilinx for any small logic designs since they froze ISE with all their sub  parts. New design requires Xilinx but could fit in a CPLD. Cost isn't too sensitive but longevity is. Is it safe to use parts that are stuck in ISE land? Must be industrial temp so the cheapest part that works on Vivado is a  Spartan 7. Massive Overkill since any  CPLD would be fine. I also hate that I can't use ISE cleanly in Win10. Hi everyone, i'm fairly new to FPGA and CPLD, i'm just on the basic stuff. amp#x200B; long story short, how hard can it be to make a code for clocking a CCD sensor (via specific commands) via an 8 bit parallel bus, then on this same bus read the data returned from the ADC at 6mhz (clock and latch are separate signals) and store it to DRAM and later to an SD Card with a FAT file system. amp#x200B; I've bought an Xilinx XC9572 board because of the compatibility with 5v signaling. amp#x2. Hi! For the past few months, I've been working on a custom (but basic) microcontroller design in VHDL. Do any of you have tips about a good first FPGA board/kit that would be capable of handling a relatively simple microcontroller? More info: I've never used a physical FPGA board before, so this will be my first foray into actual implementation on hardware. The microcontroller design works well in simulation (Aldec Active-HDL), but I know there will probably be some complications Hello, I’ve been trying to decide on a FPGA development board, and have only been able to find posts and Reddit threads from 4-5 years ago. So I wanted to start a new thread and ask about the best “mid-range” FGPA development board in 2018. (Price range 0-0.) I started with this Quora answer about FPGA boards, from 2013 (https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-affordable-FPGA-dev-kit-for-a-starter/answer/Gregory-James?ch=10ampshare=7e58beccampsrid=37TL). The Altera DE1 sounded good. Edit 2 - Solved, Thanks everyone ! So I'm working on a project that requires some processing that arduinos are too slow for. Hence a CPLD. Basically I need to switch 4 outputs on and off alternating with every incoming rising edge on an input, but set to off when the input is off. So in the first pulse (rising edge);of the input, 2 outputs go to high, when the input goes low (falling edge), all outputs are low, in the next input rising edge, the other 2 outputs go high, and when the input.

I bought it mostly for learning purposes and ended up selling it because I didn't do much with it. Not surprising since most things that tinkerers like me want to do can be done with a microcontroller. About the most elaborate thing I did with it was create an LED display driver. I just recently ordered a few 74HCxxx ICs and now I'm kind of thinking that it might be worth buying an absolute minimal FPGA board I am currently writing a web tool for converting digital schematics to VHDL which can then be implemented onto a FPGA or CPLD for my masters project in EE. The tool is designed to be used as an educational tool for teaching the fundamentals of digital design without the need for students to learn a HDL (they learn this later on in their degree). This project came about because the Xilinx 14.2 design suite included a crude but effective schematic entry tool that allowed designers to implement. 
I recently bought the contents of an electronics laboratory and store room. I found well over 10,000 ICs, some of which are really expensive on Digi-Key. All of them are brand new in vacuum sealed trays in foil packages. While most of them are between - per chip (RAM chips, basic CPLDs and Micro-controllers), prices for some of them are over ,500 per chip (High end Xilinx FPGAs). They all have labels from reputable suppliers so there is no doubt that they are genuine. So I've been working on Cypress PSoC 5LP support and got a hand-made UDB/DSI XOR-gate configuration working over JTAG. It takes input from two pins and the blue led lights up when either pin gets 3.3v! Preliminary kitprog/psoc5 support was added to openocd (https://github.com/cyrozap/OpenOCD) by cyrozap and Andreas Färber. Now it is time to implement yosys support for the PSoC 5LP. However presently the PLD can only be represented as a LUT (an ill-performing hack). `##openfpga` on freenode. Adaptable. Intelligent.
