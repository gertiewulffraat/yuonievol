Перед вами несколько диалогов на английском языке на тему at the hotel (в отеле). Все диалоги даны с переводом на русский язык. I’m guessing everyone is having issues with this. Has anyone found a solution or am I to sit here with my thumb up my. I mean play another video. Hello! I want to take my gf there to celebrate, but we have no celebrations. Wanted to just show up tonight. Will we be able to get a table? Or should we do it another night with reservation? Thanks. So I plan to bring my family to Yellowstone in late July, and do not have reservations at a hotel in the park. It that a terrible idea? What are my options if I don't get a hotel in the park? Would I have to drive out daily? amp#x200B; Should I consider to reserve a camping. 
Hello, Everyone has been raving about how Uber is so much better. So I need to get to the airport at 530am so I put in a reservation for 5am. At the end it doesn't say it reserved anything at all. Instead it tells me that I'll get a message at the end of my ride window if no one is available. Which is half an hour too late. Am I misunderstanding somewhere? It will be my job if I miss the flight, but they don't reimburse me either. Reserving a ride isn't useful unless it is reliable. First time posting, so be easy!! So the other week my wife decided she wanted to go out to dinner, and we drove past a Bravo, and we haven’t been there since our 3rd date so we pulled in. I had just found out about 20 min prior that she was pregnant so it was kind of a mini celebration! We walk into an empty lobby and surprisingly half empty restaurant on a Friday night. “Hi we would like a table for 2” “Sorry but we are fully booked up, it will be at least an hour wait, is that ok?”. Why is this one episode not easy to find? Most, if not all, of the other No Reservations episodes are purchasable on Amazon Prime. amp#x200B; I found it on Youtube, but it is badly bootlegged and unwatchable. Did something happen in the episode that created a lawsuit or something else that explains why it's missing (NOTE: Wikipedia says it is a Season 6 episode, but Amazon's empty listing for it is in Season. I just booked a trip to visit a friend who just found out she's moving to San Francisco! We'd love to head to Yosemite for July 4th. I have no permits and no camping reservations. Lol. amp#x200B; We have some flexibility - we can get there Wednesday night earliest and stay through Sunday, or go later. We'd like to do at least 2 days. I'm thinking Wednesday night stay outside the park and then spring into action to find a place to stay early Thursday. amp#x200B; What should So, I work at a very popular steakhouse as a hostess that is incredibly busy on weekends. People who have some sense will make reservations days in advance to ensure they get in. It was a Sunday evening, and we are booked solid! I mean- absolutely, absurdly busy. We cannot take in any party larger than 6, as we have an entire section of our restaurant blocked for a party of 100 . This woman, her husband, small child and I’m assuming her mother (or mother-in-law), as well as 4 more people I can be fine get several days in and then as soon as I let myself start the stinking thinking it's over. I'm done this will be day one and no longer well I entertain the thoughts for even a split second. So I’m planning a camping trip this weekend to Joshua tree March 23-24 (sat-sun) just my gf and I. We will getting there early morning on sat. What are our chances of getting a first come first serve campsite? I know it’s spring break and it’s peak season that why I’m worried all the campsites will be taken by Friday. I’m even was thinking about just driving over there Friday morning on my own just to grab a campsite for the weekend. But could I leave the campsite empty
